# FoodMap

FoodMap, a.k.a. "Cheap Food in the Eug," is an interactive map showing the under-five-dollar food options around the University of Oregon and Eugene. 

## Features
Users can click points on the map to view popups with information about restaurants, including types of food items offered for less than $5, and any days or times when there are special deals. Users can filter the points by type of restaurant (sit-down, food-cart, cafe, etc.) and by type of food (soup/salad, breakfast, pizza, sushi, etc.).


## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
For support or suggestions for added restaurants/map points, feedback can be sent through the contact page on the site or by emailing harleye@uoregon.edu.

## Roadmap
FoodMap 2.0 will include a simple submission form popup for users to submit restaurants not included on the map that meet the criteria for inclusion (food for <$5). The submissions will be compiled through Google forms, and the FoodMap points JSON will be updated regularly with the user-submitted data.
